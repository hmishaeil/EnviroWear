# EnviroWear
A multi-thread java-based application


EnviroWear is a simulator of a wearable device which can control the temperature of 5 points of the body such as left and right arms, left and right legs, and also the chest simultaneously. The assumption is that the application is receiving the input from the sensors and react accordingly. In case of detecting of any low or high temperature, the proper color changes will be applied to the user interface and application tries to decrease/increase the temperature whenever needed.

Below, a sample of output UI is provided.
